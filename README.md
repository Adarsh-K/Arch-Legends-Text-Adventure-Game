# I've made a terminal based text Adventure Game- Arch Legends. The code is in Java
To see the code open ArchLegends.java

The game's objective is to find the Boss villain and kill him. You get to be one of the following Heros all with different abilities to attack and defend plus each has a different Special Attack:
1. Warrior
2. Thief
3. Mage
4. Healer

You'll start from the starting point and proceed. In the way you'll encounter many villains, you'll fight them all till you reach the Boss. The maze is big so you may take a while to reach it. Every time you beat a villain you're level goes up ie. you cause more damage to villains when you attack and the villain causes less damage to you when you defend. The Special Attack is available once every 3 turns, so use it causiously!
You can always fight the same villain again.

Go defeat the Boss and save the world!!
